master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initizlize a repository

Head is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

Head is *note* a branch

# creates a new branch (label) called git-notes git branch git-notes

# show us whcih branch is active

--------------------------------------------------------


git init (only need to run once!)-- set up the repository


git branch XX(create branch)
git branch-- display branches
git checkoiut XX - create new branches
git status
(use git diff to check anything different)
git commit -am "Created branch XX"
git push origin XX(your branch)
Then go to codefellows/sea-c34-python and pull request. Remember to check base fork and head fork. something like "Task4 pull request from Yi Gu"
From now on, just push your changes to task4. Your teacher will merge your changes.

git status and find untrack files
git add! -- stage this file
git commit -am "YOUR MESSAGE"
